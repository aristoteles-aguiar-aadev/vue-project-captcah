This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Headed Component Tests with [Cypress Component Testing](https://on.cypress.io/component)

```sh
npm run test:unit:dev # or `npm run test:unit` for headless testing
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):



```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

```sh
npm install -g serve
serve -s dist
```
Technical Details
npm install -g serve: This command installs the serve package globally on your machine. serve is a simple, zero-configuration command-line static HTTP server that can be used to serve your static files, like the files generated by your build process.
serve -s dist: This command uses serve to serve the contents of the dist directory (which contains your production build) in a single-page application (SPA) mode. The -s flag enables SPA mode, which means that any requests that don't match a file will be served index.html. This is useful for client-side routing.
